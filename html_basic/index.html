  <h3>Learning HTML Basics</h3>

  <!-- Paragraphs -->
  <p>
    This is my first portfolio project where I practice the fundamentals of HTML. It helps me understand how to structure a webpage properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using headings, paragraphs, and images, I am learning how to create content that is both readable and visually organized.
  </p>
  <p>
    This exercise also introduces me to linking images and making them interactive, which is a key part of building engaging websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I continue, I will expand this portfolio with more pages, styles, and features to showcase my progress in web development.
